## Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture 

This week we learned about security culture and how to promote it within organizations. 

It’s important that all employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyberattacks aim to exploit human weaknesses with methods like phishing. 

For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses. 

### Scenario

- Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work. 

- Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones. 

- Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.

- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications. 

- You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

### Instructions

Compose the answers to the following four steps in a Google Doc.

#### Step 1: Measure and Set Goals 

Answer the following questions:

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
    - The first potential security attack that can be carried out with a bring your own device policy is the loss or theft of the device (Hollander, 2019). Bringing a personal computer or phone and using it for work is not a secure way to protect information. There is a risk of the device being lost. Once the device is lost, all important work information can be leaked by an individual who locates it. One way this type of an attack can be prevented, is the use of a strong password. According to information presented in class, we know that a strong password can consist of 14 or more characters, and contain the use of special characters (Wang, week 2 lecture). Although a strong password can help prevent leaked information, it is not enough to prevent skilled cyber attackers from gaining access to the device. Similarly, if a device is stolen, the work information can be easily accessed. The most secure way to prevent this type of an attack is to have separate computers or phones for employees to use for work only.
    - The second potential security attack that can be carried out with a bring your own device policy is poor mobile management (Hollander, 2019). Poor mobile management can concern instances when an employee no longer is employed by the company. If they have access to work information through their personal device, it is hard to know if that employee has removed all databases, systems, information, or anything of that nature from their personal device. Once all access is removed, the company can proceed with the termination of the employee’s account. A solution to this type of an attack is to remove the employees access to the operating system to prevent them from being able to create a malicious attack.
    - The third potential security attack that can be carried out with a bring your own device policy is malware infiltration (Hollander, 2019). Many companies that provide work access to employees' personal computers require them to download programs. Employees that are not trained properly with security techniques risk the chance to be hacked through downloading malicious software. Hackers use attacks like phishing to target these vulnerable people. Phishing attacks are common because it takes the click of one button on the wrong url or website to download malware onto a device. As soon as this link is clicked, the malware can download instantly onto the computer. This puts the company’s and all employees' information on high alert for a cyber attack. Even if the malware comes through a game download or a sports link, once an attacker gains access to a device, all their information is given to the hacker.

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? 
    -  For my first scenario, the preferred employee behavior is to ensure that your device remains with you, or in your home office space at all times when employed with the company. Keeping track of the device will provide security to the work information from a remote location. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw a 25% increase in cyberattacks within a few months (Goddard, 2021). Employees were instructed to work from home and isolate themselves unless they were considered a frontline employee. This change in workspace created issues in security when working remotely. When working remotely, many individuals switched to using personal devices rather than bringing home their work computers. Attackers were able to hack through network tracking and over the shoulder techniques.
    -  For my second scenario, the preferred employee behavior is to have a system that either HR or Information Security practices to allow the termination of an employee. Within this plan, the security department would be responsible for showing the terminating employee how to properly dispose of all work-related projects, systems, and information to provide a shield of security from that personal device. Companies that do not follow this type of system will have a higher chance of a cyber attack or information leak.
    -  For my third scenario, the preferred employee behavior is to to require a training session that is presented by HR and IS departments. This training will educate non-security educated personnel on how to view links or email attachments that are from trusted sources. Using this training, will provide the new employees with tips on what to look for when a phishing email or malicious link is sent to them. Nearly one-third of cyber attacks involve some aspect of phishing (Stone, 2021). Preventing phishing attacks will benefit the effectiveness of the company due to a stronger line of security.

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently _not_ behaving according to the preferred behavior? 
    - A method I would use to measure the effectiveness of my preferred behavior in the first scenario is to require employees to provide the location of where their device currently is before they have the ability to log out of their account. This program will then send an email to the employee of that location in case they forget the exact place of where the device is. A tracker will also be planted through a system so the device can be traced if someone had plans on stealing it. A notification will be sent if the device travels outside of a certain radius. This notification will be viewed by the owner of the device, their manager, and the IS department.
    - A method I would use to measure the effectiveness of my preferred behavior in the second scenario is to create a checklist for the plan I provided in my response to the second question. This checklist will serve as a guide that the IS department must follow to terminate the employee in a proper manner. The first part of the checklist will be about removing all systems that were downloaded from the company and onto the personal device. The second step in this process will be to remove all documents and databases that have confidential information included in them. The third and final step will be to remove access from the device to the company’s main server.
    - A method I would use to measure the effectiveness of my preferred behavior in the third scenario is to have an annual training on proper ways to approach possible phishing attacks. As I have previously stated, phishing attacks have become more prevalent in the “work from home” era of technology. In order to provide a higher state of security is to educate those who lack the expertise of cyber related content. Depending on how many phishing emails and links are clicked on, the amount of training per year may vary. The amount of times phishing attacks are successful will be monitored by the IS team. If there is an employee that generates multiple malicious softwares from phishing emails, that employee will have further training on how to safely search for emails from trusted sources.

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? 
    - The goal that I want the organization to reach is to minimize the amount of cyber breaches and maintain the highest level of security that a work from home employee can have. Personal devices that contain mass amounts of confidential information have many vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. There are many ways to prevent these attacks from occurring, but there are also skilled hackers that can penetrate any device no matter the level of security. Taking the three scenarios I have laid out and applying them into an organization will decrease the vulnerability of a cyber attack. Being thorough with the amount of security techniques we offer will be the best way to eliminate malicious software breaches.


#### Step 2: Involve the Right People 

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?  

- Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be. 
    - Department #1: Information Security
Information Security will have the role of presenting and educating all three scenarios with information to the employees. They are the front line of online security and will help maintain a high level of security. They will also be in touch with incident response to respond to every cyber attack.
    - Department #2: Human Resources
Human Resources will have the role of training employees with basic security enhancements. During their first week of work, the new employees will be educated on what systems they need to download to their computers. They will also train all current employees annually with new techniques the company has required.
    - Department #3: Information Technology
Information Technology will have the role of assisting employees with technological issues. They will have access to every employee's device and can mirror their screens to ensure that issues are resolved. Working one-on-one with the employee will show employees how to fix simple errors in the future.
    - Department #4: C-Level Officers
C-Level Officers that are going to be involved will be the CEO, CISO, and CIO. The first point of contact for security breaches will be the Chief Information Officer (CIO). They will then relay all security concerns to the CISO and CEO of the company to let them know what caused the breach and how it was handled.
    - Department #5: Physical Security
Physical Security will have an in person role rather than an online presence. They will be physically garding the building to ensure no attackers or tailgators are entering the building while employees can work from home. This is important to the company because physical security needs to handle incidents as soon as possible.


#### Step 3: Training Plan 

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:

* How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)
    -  The training program we use will occur annually. Having a training program once a year, provides employees with an updated understanding of the security policies we have implemented. If the rate of cyber attacks the company receives is too high, then we will enforce more training seminars. The security team will dissect the original training program and find weaknesses to improve on. Failure to comply with the training will result in the inability to continue work.
    -  The location of the training will vary depending on the department. As of now, there would be employees that are working from home. These employees will be given the option to take the training from a remote location or take it in person. It would be preferred that every employee takes this training in person because that is how we will know how attentive each employee is. If the worker is on-site, then they will be required to complete the training during weekday work hours. The training that will be implemented will be a combination of virtual and in person seminars.

* What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)
    - In the first scenario, I mentioned the risk of losing or having a personal device stolen. This will lead to the ability for hackers to attack the company using the information provided on the device. This is the first topic of the training. In this seminar, we will teach employees tips and strategies on how to not leave a personal device unattended in the workplace and out of the workplace. Next, we will introduce the new chip that will be plugged into every personal device that contains confidential information. This chip will be a tracker for the device if it were to be misplaced. After this, we will close the first part of the training session with procedures and policies that are being factored into the security measures. The main policy we will provide is an automated service that will help employees remember where their device was left before they log out of their accounts.
    - In the second scenario, I mentioned the steps our company will take when there is a termination occurring. There is not much being done with this scenario in the training. However, each and every current and new employee will understand the process of an employee termination and what the security team does during this time.
    - In the third scenario, I mentioned the importance of not clicking random links. Phishing emails will contain malicious software that can be downloaded with the click of a button. We will include steps employees can take to determine if the email is from a trusted and reputable source. Typically phishing emails try to target the C-level officers. They will be pointed out during the training and more emphasis will be given to their positions. Phishing emails can happen to anyone at any time. Having a majority of the training discussing phishing emails will reduce the number of attacks the company will receive.

* After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 
    - Before the training, I will have the data analytics team and security team work together. The security team will be responsible for providing every occurrence from the past year of a cyber attack. After getting a list of what software the attacker used, how they used it, and how it was fixed, they will send that list over to the data analytics department. After this, the data analytics team will look at the numbers from previous years and note the percent of change. After the training is complete for every employee, the security team will continue to monitor every cyber attack the company faces. Once they regain the number of attacks from the current year, the data analytics team will note the rate of change. This will determine how effective the training was and how we can improve as a company to become a more secure organization.
This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda.
